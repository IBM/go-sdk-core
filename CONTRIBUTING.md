# Code
## Commit Messages
Commit messages should follow the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).
This is because our release tool - [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) -
uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs.
Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
can be used to help contributors and enforce commit messages.
Here are some examples of acceptable commit messages, along with the release type that would be done based on the commit message:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                              | Release type               |

# Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the repository, here's a quick guide:
  1. Fork the repository  
  
  2. The `go-sdk-core` project uses Go modules for dependency management, so do NOT set the `GOPATH` environment 
  variable to include your local `go-sdk-core` project directory.  
  
  3. Clone the respository into a local directory.  
  
  4. Install the `golangci-lint` tool:
     ```sh
     curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh| sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.31.0
     ```  
  * Note: As of this writing, the 1.31.0 version of `golangci-lint` is being used by this project.
  Please check the `curl` command found in the `.travis.yml` file to see the version of this tool that is currently 
  being used at the time you are planning to commit changes. This will ensure that you are using the same version 
  of the linter as the Travis build automation, which will ensure that you are using the same set of linter checks
  that the automated build uses.  
  
  5. Make your code changes as needed.  Be sure to add new tests for any new or modified functionality.  
  
  6. Test your changes:
     ```sh
     make test
     ```
     The above command will run all the unit tests with the command `go test -tags=all`.
     Each unit test file contains one or more build tags as a way to classify the
     tests into various groups (example: `// +build all fast auth`).
     Currently, these tags include: all, slow, fast, auth, basesvc, log and retries.
     Others might be added in the future.
     To run a specific class of tests (example 'retries'), use a command like this:
     ```
     cd v5/core
     go test -tags=retries
     ```
     
  7. Check your code for lint issues:
     ```sh
     make lint
     ```
  
  8. Alternatively, to build, test and lint check in one step:
     ```sh
     make all
     ```
  9. Commit your changes:
  * Commit messages should follow the Angular commit message guidelines as mentioned above.
  
  10. Push your commit(s) to your fork and submit a pull request to the **main** branch.
