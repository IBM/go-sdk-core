# go-sdk-core

This project contains the core functionality used by Go SDK's generated by the IBM OpenAPI 3 SDK Generator (openapi-sdkgen).
Go code generated by openapi-sdkgen will depend on the function contained in this project.

## Installation

Get SDK package:
```bash
go get -u github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/...
```

## Authentication Types
There are several flavors of authentication supported in this package. To specify the intended authentication pattern to use, the user can pass in the parameter `AuthenticationType`. This parameter is optional, but it may become required in a future major release. The options for this parameter are `basic`, `iam`, and `icp4d`.

### basic
This indicates Basic Auth is to be used. Users will pass in a `username` and `password` and the SDK will generate a Basic Auth header to send with requests to the service.

### iam
This indicates that IAM token authentication is to be used. Users can pass in an `IAMApiKey` or an `IAMAccessToken`. If an API key is used, the SDK will manage the token for the user. In either case, the SDK will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.

### icp4d
This indicates that the service is an instance of ICP4D, which has its own version of token authentication. Users can pass in a `username` and `password`, or a `ICP4DAccessToken`.
If a username and password is given, the SDK will manage the token for the user, and the `ICP4DURL` option **must** be passed in.
